    "<b>My own idea</b> is a step by step conformation generation. Like the one presented in [1] which is a conditional variational autoencoder that generates the atoms one by one, however in this approach, it generates the type and position of the atom. In conformation generation case, the type of the atom is already known, only the location of the atom is required so it can skip one step in the process and makes the generation even faster. Or to look at torsional angles as it is the case in [2]\n"

    "In case of defining an input-output sequence, then a graph neural network is not much needed to generate the different conformations as the molecule would be treated as a whole not as a set of different connected entities. That's also one question that can be looked into. All the previous works used graph neural networks as it seemed intuitive to look at a molecule as a graph. Another way maybe to generate the permitted rotations of the bonds and use this as an output to find the range of different orientations. Then comes the data representation by Pytorch Geometric that already represents the QM9 dataset as a graph with features connected to each of the molecules.<br>"
